# Getting started

## Prerequisite

This section is a quick _What frugal can do_. In it, we will build a small blog. You will need:

- **Deno** version {{DENO_VERSION}} or higher,
- a code editor,
- **15 minutes** of your time

For this quickstart, we will use typescript (since it works natively in Deno), but you are free to use vanilla javascript if you want.
