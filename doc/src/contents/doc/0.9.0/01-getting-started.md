# Getting started

##Â Prerequisite

This section is a quick "what frugal can do". In it we will build a small blog. You need will need :

- **Deno** version 1.35 or higher,
- a code editor,
- **15 minutes** of your time

For this quickstart we will use typescript (since it works natively in deno), but you are free to use vanilla javascript if you want.
